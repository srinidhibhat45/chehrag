"""Chunking strategies.

Design note — why these strategies and not the textbook set
-----------------------------------------------------------
Measured corpus statistics drove this, not folklore. MS MARCO passages here are
mean 317 / median 295 chars (~60-80 tokens). They are *already chunk-sized*.

That kills the usual playbook. A 512-token fixed-size splitter over a 295-char
passage emits exactly one chunk identical to the input: an expensive no-op. The
brief warns against naive fixed-size chunking; on this corpus it is not merely
naive, it is inert.

So the axes that actually pay here are:
  (a) going *finer* than a passage   -> sentence / sliding window
  (b) going *coarser* than a passage -> document merge across a query group
  (c) changing what gets embedded    -> contextual enrichment
  (d) changing the matching function -> lexical BM25 alongside dense

Each strategy below states what it wins and what it costs. Strategy 5 (semantic)
is included knowing it has little room on 3-sentence passages -- we measure its
contribution rather than assume it, and report the result honestly.
